# Aymara Python SDK

<!-- sphinx-doc-begin -->

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ We're [Aymara](https://aymara.ai/).

We help developers measure & improve the alignment of their genAI applications, making genAI safer & more accurate. 

So we built this library for you.

Aymara Python SDK provides convenient access to the Aymara REST API from a Python 3.7+ application. The SDK includes [type definitions](https://github.com/aymara-ai/aymara-ai/blob/main/aymara_sdk/types.py) for requests & responses and offers synchronous & asynchronous clients powered by asyncio.

If you found a bug, have a question, or want to request a feature, say hello at [sdk-support@aymara.ai](mailto:sdk-support@aymara.ai) or [open an issue](https://github.com/aymara-ai/aymara-ai/issues/new) on our GitHub repo.

## Documentation

[docs.aymara.ai](http://docs.aymara.ai/) has our full library API. [api.aymara.ai/docs](https://api.aymara.ai/docs) has our REST API documentation.

## Features

Now
- Create safety tests
- Score test answers
- Get and graph test scores
- Asynchronous & synchronous test creation and scoring

Upcoming
- Jailbreak tests
- Hallucination tests
- Text-to-image tests
- AI regulation tests 

## Installation

```bash
pip install aymara-ai
```

## Configuration

The SDK needs to know who you are. Create an `.env` file in your project root with your Aymara API key:

```bash
AYMARA_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Or supply your key directly to the client:

```python
client = AymaraAI(api_key="your_api_key")
```

## Usage

### Synchronous Example

```python
import json
from sdk import AymaraAI
import MyGenAI  # Replace with your genAI client

# Initialize the client
client = AymaraAI(api_key="your_api_key")

# Create a test synchronously
result = client.create_test(
    test_name="misinformation_test_240824",  # a human-readable name for your test
    student_description="MyGenAI, a chatbot hat answers user questions.",  # a description of your genAI
    test_policy="Do not generate or encourage misinformation: false, inaccurate, or misleading information that is spread without the intent to deceive.",  # the safety policy you want to test
    n_test_questions=20,  # the number of questions in your test
)

# Get test questions
for question in result.questions:
    print(f"UUID: {question.question_uuid}")
    print(f"Text: {question.question_text}")

# Test your genAI (referred to as a student) with your test questions
student_responses = []
for question in result.questions:
    answer_text = MyGenAI.answer_prompt(question.question_text)
    student_responses.append({
        "question_uuid": str(question.question_uuid),
        "answer_text": answer_text
    })

# Score your test answers
score_run_response = client.score_test(
    test_uuid=result.test_uuid,
    student_response_json=json.dumps(student_responses),
)

# View the test answers that did not pass
for answer in score_run_response.answers:
    print(f"Question Text: {answer.question_text}")
    print(f"Answer Text: {answer.answer_text}")
    print(f"Explanation: {answer.explanation}")  # Explanation of why the answer didn't comply with the safety policy
    print(f"Confidence: {answer.confidence}")  # Probability confidence the answer didn't comply with the safety policy

# Get your test's answer pass statistics
AymaraAI.get_pass_stats(score_run_response)

# View your test's answer pass rates in a graph
AymaraAI.graph_pass_rates(score_run_response)
```

### Asynchronous Example

```python
import asyncio
import json
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from sdk import AymaraAI
import YourGenAI  # replace with your actual student implementation

load_dotenv() # If using environment variables
async def main():
    async with AymaraAI() as client:
        # Create a test asynchronously
        result = await client.create_test_async(
            test_name="Sample Test",
            student_description="This is a sample description for the student.",
            test_policy="Your safety policy here",
            n_test_questions=2
        )

        # Wait for the test to be ready
        test = await client.get_test_async(test_uuid=result.test_uuid)
        while test.test_status != "completed":
            await asyncio.sleep(5)
            test = await client.get_test_async(test_uuid=result.test_uuid)

        # Print test questions
        for i, question in enumerate(test.questions, 1):
            print(f"Question {i}:")
            print(f"UUID: {question.question_uuid}")
            print(f"Text: {question.question_text}")

        # Use the questions above to get outputs from your LLM (referred to as student)
        student = YourStudent()
        question_answers = []
        for question in test.questions:
            answer_text = student.answer_question(question=question.question_text)
            question_answers.append({
                "question_uuid": str(question.question_uuid),
                "answer_text": answer_text
            })

        # Score the test asynchronously
        score_run_response = await client.score_test_async(
            test_uuid=result.test_uuid,
            student_response_json=json.dumps(question_answers)
        )


        # Wait for the scores to be ready
        while score_run_response.score_run_status != "completed":
            await asyncio.sleep(5)
            score_run_response = await client.get_score_run_async(
                score_run_uuid=score_run_response.score_run_uuid
            )

        # Print score results
        for i, answer in enumerate(score_run_response.answers, 1):
            print(f"Answer {i}:")
            print(f"Question Text: {answer.question_text}")
print(f"Answer Text: {answer.answer_text}")
print(f"Is Safe: {answer.is_safe}")
            print(f"Confidence: {answer.confidence}")
            print(f"Explanation: {answer.explanation}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Both the synchronous and asynchronous methods allow for auomatically waiting for question generation and scoring to complete using the `wait_for_completion` flag.

## Versioning

This package generally follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) conventions. Some backwards-incompatible changes may be released as minor versions if they affect:

1. Static types without breaking runtime behavior.

3. Virtually no users in practice.

We take backwards-compatibility seriously and will ensure to give you a smooth upgrade experience.
